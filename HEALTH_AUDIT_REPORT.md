# Project Health Audit Report

## 1. Project Health & Debugging

### Findings
-   **Configuration Files:**
    *   `apphosting.yaml`: Placeholder, `memoryMiB: 512` flagged as discrepancy.
    *   `firebase.json`: Minimal hosting config, `public` dir for assets is missing. Lacks definitions for other Firebase services.
    *   `next.config.ts`: Critical issue - `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors: true`.
    *   `package.json`: Missing Node.js engine spec, likely missing Firebase/Genkit dependencies.
    *   `tsconfig.json`: Generally okay (`strict: true`), but `paths` alias `@/*` points to non-existent `src/`.
-   **Missing Core Directories:** `src/` (for application code) and `public/` (for Firebase hosting assets) are absent.
-   **Logging:** `logs/blueprint-mode.log` and `logs/mode-handovers.md` are empty. Roo's task-specific logs/audit reports (mentioned in UDM) are missing from the repository. No discoverable logging implementation.
-   **Development Plan vs. Progress (Roo AI):**
    *   UDM `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md` states `PHASE-0` (Roo's initial audit/setup) is `VALIDATED`.
    *   `state/blueprint_state.json` shows `PHASE-0` and `MILESTONE-P0-M0.1` as `FAILED_VALIDATION`. `current_task` is `TASK-P0-M0.1-T009` (validation task), `ready_to_commence_cycle_one` is `false`. This is a critical discrepancy.
-   **Functional/Non-Functional Requirements:**
    *   ISA application functional requirements cannot be met as application code is missing.
    *   Roo's non-functional requirements (e.g., UDM as single source of truth, auditability) have gaps due to UDM/state inconsistency and missing logs.

### Actionable Remediation Steps
-   `apphosting.yaml`: Populate with actual App Hosting configuration.
-   `firebase.json`: Define configurations for all Firebase services to be used (Functions, Firestore, Storage etc.) including security rules. Create `public/` directory.
-   `next.config.ts`: Set `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors: false`. Address all resulting ESLint errors.
-   `package.json`: Add `engines` field for Node.js version. Add all required dependencies (Firebase SDKs, Genkit packages).
-   `src/` Directory: Create `src/` and establish a basic Next.js application structure as outlined in UDM `02-System-Architecture.md`.
-   Logging: Implement a logging framework. Investigate and ensure Roo's logs are generated and stored as per UDM if Roo's development is to continue.
-   Roo's State: Investigate `TASK-P0-M0.1-T009` failure. Align UDM `05` with actual state in `blueprint_state.json`.

### Risks & Concerns
-   Inability to build/deploy ISA application due to missing code/configs.
-   Degraded code quality and hidden bugs due to ESLint errors being ignored.
-   Inconsistent environments due to unspecified Node.js version.
-   Stalled AI-driven development if Roo's `PHASE-0` failure is not addressed.
-   Difficult debugging due to lack of logs.

## 2. Test Coverage & Dependency Verification

### Findings
-   **Dependency Audit (Existing):**
    -   An audit of project dependencies was performed using `npm audit`.
    -   The following vulnerabilities were identified in the `next` package (v14.2.3 at time of audit):
        -   Critical: 1 (GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)
        -   High: 2 (GHSA-gp8f-8m3g-qvj9, GHSA-7gfc-8cq8-jh5f)
        -   Moderate: 2 (GHSA-g77x-44xx-532m, GHSA-7m27-7ghc-44w9)
        -   Low: 2 (GHSA-qpjv-v59x-3qc4, GHSA-3h52-269p-cp9r)
    -   A `package-lock.json` file was generated/updated during the process.
-   **Test Infrastructure:**
    *   No test files, directories (`__tests__`, `*.test.ts`), or specific test scripts (beyond basic `npm test`) found.
    *   UDM `07-Testing-QA.md` is largely a placeholder, outlining future strategy (Genkit testing, Jest/Vitest) but no current implementation.
-   **Dependency Completeness (New):**
    *   `package.json` is missing an `engines` field for Node.js version specification.
    *   Key dependencies for Firebase (e.g., `firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions`) and Genkit (e.g., `@genkit-ai/core`, `@genkit-ai/firebase`) are not listed in `package.json`.

### Actionable Remediation Steps
-   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Existing):**
    -   Run `npm audit fix --force` to attempt to automatically fix vulnerabilities in `next`. (Note: `next@14.2.30` was suggested as a fix for `next`).
    -   If issues persist, manually update `next` to the latest stable and secure version.
    -   Regularly run `npm audit` as part of the development lifecycle and CI pipeline.
-   **Testing Framework & Strategy (New):**
    *   Define a comprehensive testing strategy incorporating unit, integration, and E2E tests.
    *   Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest or Vitest) and configure it for the Next.js environment.
    *   Write initial tests for any new code, especially core utilities, components, and API endpoints.
    *   Integrate Genkit's evaluation tools and testing utilities once Genkit flows are developed.
    *   Add a dedicated `test` script to `package.json` that runs all types of tests.
-   **Complete Dependencies (New):**
    *   Add an `engines` field to `package.json` (e.g., `"node": ">=18.0.0"`).
    *   Install and save necessary Firebase SDKs (e.g., `npm install firebase-admin firebase-functions`) and Genkit packages (e.g., `npm install @genkit-ai/core @genkit-ai/firebase @genkit-ai/googleai`).

### Risks & Concerns
-   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Existing):**
    -   Identified vulnerabilities can expose the application to security threats (DoS, data exposure, etc.).
-   **Lack of Testing (New):**
    *   High risk of regressions and bugs entering production with no automated testing.
    *   Inability to verify code quality or functionality systematically, slowing down development and reducing confidence in releases.
-   **Missing Dependencies (New):**
    *   Blocked development for any features requiring Firebase or Genkit functionality.
    *   Potential for runtime errors if code assumes these dependencies exist.

## 3. Logging, Configuration & Modes Audit

### Findings
-   **Logging:** No discoverable application-level or Genkit-specific logging implementation. Existing log files (`logs/blueprint-mode.log`, `logs/mode-handovers.md`) are empty. Roo's task-specific logs, crucial for its auditability (a UDM principle), are missing from the repository.
-   **Environment Files:** `.gitignore` correctly excludes `.env.*` files, which is good practice for managing sensitive configurations.
-   **`.roomodes` File:** This file is empty (`{"customModes": []}`). Its purpose and interaction with `prompts/` and UDM `04-Roo-Modes.md` (which defines various modes) is unclear. If it's a manifest for the "Roo Code workspace", it's non-functional.
-   **`.clinerules-*` Files:** No such files related to "Clinician rules" were found at the project root or in configuration directories.
-   **Memory-Bank Files:** `memory_bank/history/events.json` is empty, potentially impairing Roo's learning or historical event tracking. `memory_bank/PROJECT_RESOURCES.md` is comprehensive. The root `README.md` is basic but accurately states the application code is missing.
-   **UDM Consistency:**
    *   Critical inconsistency: `PHASE-0` status is `VALIDATED` in UDM `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md` but `FAILED_VALIDATION` in `state/blueprint_state.json`.
    *   UDM `04-Roo-Modes.md` contains some internal duplication and inconsistencies in Mode IDs.

### Actionable Remediation Steps
-   **Logging:**
    *   Implement a robust logging framework (e.g., Winston or Pino) for application-level events.
    *   Configure Genkit flows to utilize built-in logging and tracing, ensuring logs are captured appropriately (e.g., Cloud Logging if deploying to Firebase/Google Cloud).
    *   Investigate and ensure Roo's operational logs are generated, captured, and stored as per UDM requirements if its development is to continue.
-   **`.roomodes`:** Clarify the purpose of `.roomodes`. If it's a manifest for Roo, populate it based on UDM `04` and the available prompts in `prompts/`. Ensure the "Roo Code workspace" can correctly interpret it.
-   **Memory Bank:** Ensure Roo populates `memory_bank/history/events.json` if this is part of its intended memory architecture and learning process.
-   **UDM Corrections:**
    *   Reconcile the `PHASE-0` status between UDM `05` and `blueprint_state.json`. The state file likely reflects the true status.
    *   Review and clean up UDM `04-Roo-Modes.md` to remove duplications and ensure consistent Mode IDs.

### Risks & Concerns
-   Inability to debug, monitor, or trace system behavior effectively without proper logging. This violates the "Absolute Auditability" principle for Roo.
-   Potential failure or misconfiguration of the "Roo Code workspace" integration if `.roomodes` is critical and empty or misinterpreted.
-   Erosion of trust in the UDM as the single source of truth if inconsistencies are not resolved.
-   Roo's memory, learning capability, and context awareness might be impaired if `events.json` is unused or it cannot log its actions.

## 4. Repository Structure & Redundancy Cleanup

### Findings
-   **Branch Analysis (Existing):**
    -   The repository currently has one primary local branch: `14-6-juni`.
    -   There is a corresponding remote branch: `remotes/origin/14-6-juni`.
    -   The HEAD is currently detached, pointing directly to commit `ee843bb`.
-   **Directory Structure:**
    *   Major gap: The `src/` directory for Next.js application code is missing.
    *   The `public/` directory for Firebase Hosting static assets is also missing.
    *   The structure for Roo's AI framework (`docs`, `prompts`, `state`, `memory_bank`) is relatively clear.
    *   `.DS_Store` files were noted in Roo's UDM `02-System-Architecture.md` audit (and are correctly listed in `.gitignore`).
-   **Redundancy & Clutter:**
    *   `prompts/roo_mode_research_prompt_v1.1.prompt.txt` and `prompts/roo_mode_research_prompt_v1.2.prompt.txt` appear superseded by `prompts/roo_mode_research_prompt_v1.3.txt`.
    *   Duplicate mode definitions are present at the end of `docs/udm/04-Roo-Modes.md`.
    *   Several top-level `.md` files (`firebase_specific_research_needs.md`, `identified_research_needs.md`, `project_genkit_specific_research_needs.md`, `project_nextjs_specific_research_needs.md`) seem like working notes or initial research rather than persistent documentation.
-   **Configuration Drift:** Significant drift exists between UDM plans and the actual repository state (missing `src/` and `public/` directories, empty `.roomodes` file, Phase 0 status conflict, missing dependencies, no logs).
-   **Naming Conventions:** Generally consistent (kebab-case for files/folders, PascalCase for components if they existed). UDM Task IDs are systematic. Roo Mode IDs in UDM `04` have some inconsistencies that need alignment.

### Actionable Remediation Steps
-   **Branch Management (Existing):**
    -   If `14-6-juni` is the main development branch, ensure developers work on this or feature branches derived from it.
    -   Create a branch from the detached HEAD commit `ee843bb` if it contains relevant work (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/some-feature ee843bb`). Otherwise, switch to the main branch (`git checkout 14-6-juni`).
    -   Implement and enforce a clear branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow or GitHub Flow).
-   **Directory Structure:**
    *   Create the `src/` directory and populate it with a basic Next.js application structure (e.g., `pages/`, `components/`) as outlined in UDM `02`.
    *   Create the `public/` directory for static assets.
-   **Clean Up Redundancy:**
    *   Move working-note `.md` files from the root directory to a subfolder within `docs/` (e.g., `docs/internal-research/` or `docs/archive/`).
    *   Remove obsolete prompt files (research v1.1, v1.2) after confirming v1.3 is the canonical version.
    *   Consolidate and remove duplicate definitions in `docs/udm/04-Roo-Modes.md`.
    *   Align Roo Mode IDs in UDM `04` for consistency.
-   **Address Configuration Drift:** Systematically address drift issues identified in other sections (dependencies, configurations, logging, Roo state).

### Risks & Concerns
-   **Branch Management (Existing):** A detached HEAD can lead to lost work. Lack of a clear strategy causes confusion.
-   **Disorganization:** A cluttered root directory and outdated/duplicated files can make the project harder to navigate and understand.
-   **Misinformation:** Confusion from outdated or duplicated documentation and prompts can lead to errors or wasted effort.
-   **Execution Errors:** Misunderstandings or errors in execution if the UDM and actual project state are not aligned.

## 5. Development Efficiency & Best Practices

### Findings
-   **Workflow Efficiency:**
    *   Basic Next.js scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`) exist in `package.json`, but there's no application code in `src/` to run them on.
    *   No scripts or configurations for running the Firebase Emulator suite locally.
    *   No Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are defined (e.g., no `.github/workflows` or `cloudbuild.yaml`).
-   **Potential Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Fundamental Blocker:** Missing `src/` application code.
    *   **Code Quality Blindspot:** `eslint: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` in `next.config.ts` hides linting issues, leading to technical debt.
    *   **AI Stagnation:** Roo's `FAILED_VALIDATION` for `PHASE-0` halts its development contributions.
    *   **Dependency Gaps:** Missing Firebase/Genkit dependencies in `package.json` block development of core features.
    *   **Manual Processes:** Lack of CI/CD means builds, tests, and deployments are manual and error-prone.
    *   **Incomplete Configurations:** Placeholder or missing configurations (`apphosting.yaml`, `firebase.json`) prevent deployment and full feature utilization.
    *   **No Test Infrastructure:** Absence of tests means quality assurance is manual and regressions are likely.
    *   **Poor Debuggability:** Sparse logging makes troubleshooting difficult.
-   **Adherence to Standards:**
    *   **Coding Standards:** ESLint is configured but critically undermined by `ignoreBuildErrors: true`. Prettier (for code formatting) is not configured. TypeScript's `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` is a good practice.
    *   **Firebase Practices:** Best practices cannot be fully assessed due to the incomplete `firebase.json`. Conceptual adherence (e.g., secret management discussed in UDM) is noted, but practical implementation is missing.
    *   **GS1/ISA Compliance:** Not verifiable as the ISA application code (and thus any GS1-related logic) doesn't exist.

### Actionable Remediation Steps
-   **Local Development:**
    *   Implement Firebase Emulator suite setup and add scripts to `package.json` (e.g., `npm run emulators`, `npm run dev:emulators`) for easy local development and testing of Firebase-dependent features.
-   **Automation (CI/CD):**
    *   Establish CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions).
    *   Initial pipeline should include: linting, running tests, building the application.
    *   Future enhancements: automated deployments, dependency vulnerability scanning.
-   **Address Bottlenecks:**
    *   Create `src/` and implement the initial application.
    *   Set `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors: false` in `next.config.ts` and fix all reported lint issues.
    *   Investigate and resolve Roo's `PHASE-0` validation failure.
    *   Add all missing dependencies to `package.json`.
    *   Complete all necessary configuration files.
    *   Implement the testing infrastructure and write initial tests.
    *   Set up comprehensive logging.
-   **Coding Standards Enforcement:**
    *   Configure Prettier and integrate it into the CI pipeline and pre-commit hooks.
    *   Ensure new Firebase configurations (`firebase.json`, security rules) adhere to documented best practices.
-   **Documentation:** Ensure UDM documents are updated to reflect all these changes once implemented.

### Risks & Concerns
-   Slow and inefficient development lifecycle due to manual processes and lack of local emulation for Firebase services.
-   Accumulation of technical debt and bugs due to poor coding practices not being caught early (ESLint override, no Prettier).
-   Project stagnation if Roo's AI-driven development issues are not resolved.
-   Inability to ensure consistent quality or prevent regressions without CI/CD and automated testing.
-   Deployment failures or runtime issues due to incomplete or incorrect configurations.

## Overall Summary of Key Risks & Concerns
-   **Critical: Application Does Not Exist:** The most fundamental issue is the absence of the `src/` directory and any actual ISA application code. The project is currently a framework for building an application, not the application itself.
-   **Critical: Security Vulnerabilities:** `npm audit` reported 1 critical, 2 high, 2 moderate, 2 low vulnerabilities in the `next` package (v14.2.3 at the time of the initial audit). These must be addressed.
-   **Critical: Stalled AI Development Process:** Roo's `PHASE-0` has `FAILED_VALIDATION` according to `state/blueprint_state.json`, halting its autonomous development lifecycle. The reasons are unknown due to missing logs from Roo's operations.
-   **High: Degraded Code Quality & Hidden Bugs:** `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors: true` in `next.config.ts` allows linting errors into the codebase, masking potential issues and accumulating technical debt.
-   **High: Lack of Testing Infrastructure:** No automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) exist, significantly increasing the risk of regressions and bugs making their way into deployment.
-   **High: Missing Core Dependencies:** `package.json` lacks essential Firebase SDKs (e.g., `firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions`) and Genkit packages (e.g., `@genkit-ai/core`), which are critical for the documented architecture and will block development.
-   **Medium: Incomplete or Placeholder Configurations:** Key configuration files like `apphosting.yaml` (for Google Cloud App Hosting) and `firebase.json` are either placeholders or minimally configured, hindering deployment and full feature utilization.
-   **Medium: Inadequate Logging:** The lack of a structured runtime logging mechanism makes debugging, monitoring, and auditing extremely difficult. Roo's operational logs are also missing, impeding understanding of its processes.
-   **Medium: Configuration Drift & UDM Inconsistency:** Significant discrepancies exist between the Universal Document Model (UDM) plans (e.g., Phase 0 status, `.roomodes` intent, architectural components) and the actual state of the repository and Roo's operational data.
-   **Medium: Inefficient Development Workflow:** The absence of CI/CD pipelines, lack of Firebase Emulator setup for local development, and manual quality checks contribute to a slow and error-prone development cycle.
-   **Medium: Branch Management Issues:** The current detached HEAD state and lack of a clear, enforced branching strategy can lead to confusion and lost work.

## Recommendations for Long-Term Project Health
1.  **Prioritize Foundational Setup (Immediate):**
    *   Address the missing `src/` directory by creating it and populating a basic Next.js structure.
    *   Install all core dependencies (`firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions`, Genkit packages, etc.) into `package.json`.
    *   Specify Node.js engine in `package.json`.
    *   Correct critical configuration issues: set `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors: false` in `next.config.ts` and fix resulting errors; properly configure `apphosting.yaml` and `firebase.json`.
    *   Address the `npm audit` vulnerabilities, starting with the critical ones for `next`.
2.  **Resolve Roo's Validation Failure (Immediate):** Investigate why `TASK-P0-M0.1-T009` failed and Roo's `PHASE-0` is stalled (per `blueprint_state.json`). This is crucial if AI-driven development is to continue. Ensure Roo's logging is functional to aid this.
3.  **Embed Quality Practices (Short-Term):**
    *   Enforce ESLint rules (after fixing initial errors) and integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting.
    *   Establish robust testing practices: set up a framework (Jest/Vitest), write initial unit/integration tests for new code, and plan for E2E tests.
    *   Integrate linting and testing into CI/CD pipelines.
4.  **Automate Processes (Short-Term):** Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated linting, testing, building, and potentially deployments to staging environments.
5.  **Enhance Local Development Efficiency (Short-Term):** Provide Firebase Emulator suite setup and associated npm scripts for easy local development and testing of Firebase-dependent features.
6.  **Maintain UDM Integrity (Ongoing):**
    *   Resolve all identified inconsistencies between the UDM and the actual project state (especially Roo's phase status, `.roomodes` functionality, architectural diagrams vs. reality).
    *   Implement processes (automated checks or manual reviews) to keep the UDM synchronized with the evolving project.
7.  **Structured Logging & Monitoring (Short to Medium-Term):** Implement comprehensive, structured logging across the application and any AI components. Plan for and set up monitoring for key application and system metrics once deployed.
8.  **Clear Branching Strategy (Immediate & Ongoing):** Define, document, and enforce a consistent branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or a simpler model like GitHub Flow). Resolve the current detached HEAD situation.
9.  **Repository Cleanup (Short-Term):** Organize the repository by moving working notes from the root to `docs/`, removing obsolete files, and ensuring clarity in file/folder naming.
10. **Progressive Feature Development (Medium-Term):** Once the foundation is stable and quality practices are in place, develop ISA application features incrementally. Each increment should include application code, corresponding tests, and any necessary updates to documentation (including the UDM).

This report will be updated as more information is gathered from further audit tasks.

# Project Roadmap Position Summary

## The Five Strategic Cycles

The project's long-term development is structured around five strategic cycles, as outlined in the Unified Development Manual (UDM):

1.  **Cycle 1: Foundational Setup & Core Intelligence Activation**
2.  **Cycle 2: Knowledge Integration & Core ISA Functionality**
3.  **Cycle 3: Advanced Intelligence & Self-Optimization**
4.  **Cycle 4: Strategic Foresight & Global Dominance Preparation**
5.  **Cycle 5: Perpetual Evolution & Sentient-Level Intelligence**

## Current Position: Start of Cycle 1

The project is currently positioned at the very beginning of **Cycle 1: Foundational Setup & Core Intelligence Activation**.

Key objectives for this initial cycle, as indicated by the UDM, include:

*   Implementing `ClaudeBrowserMode`, which involves integrating Claude Sonnet 3.5.
*   Establishing the core application `src/` directory structure, which is a fundamental step for organizing the codebase.

## Transition Recommendation

While Phase 0 (Systemic Actualization) is officially marked as `VALIDATED` and complete, a significant number of tasks within its `MILESTONE-P0-M0.1` (Initial Setup & Documentation) are still listed as `TODO`. Addressing these remaining `TODO` tasks from Phase 0 would be beneficial for ensuring a clean, fully validated, and well-documented transition into the active work of Cycle 1. This would help mitigate potential risks or overlooked details from the foundational phase.

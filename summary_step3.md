# Project Configuration Setup Summary

## Application Hosting (`apphosting.yaml`)

The `apphosting.yaml` file appears to be in a placeholder state. It includes a `memoryMiB: 512` setting, which has been previously identified as an issue. This setting was supposed to be audited as part of Phase 0 task `TASK-P0-M0.1-T001` (Audit Configuration Files), which is marked `VALIDATED`. The persistence of this placeholder value suggests a potential gap in the audit follow-up or documentation.

## Firebase Configuration (`firebase.json`)

The `firebase.json` file provides basic hosting configuration. The settings suggest it's configured for a Single Page Application (SPA) or a Next.js application, with `"source": "."` indicating the root directory serves as the base for deployment, and rewrite rules typical for SPA routing (`"destination": "/index.html"`).

## Technology Stack

Based on file names, content, and references within the Unified Development Manual (UDM), the project utilizes:

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Hosting:** Firebase / Google Cloud App Hosting

This is supported by the presence of `next.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, and the Firebase configuration files, as well as UDM task descriptions.

## Dual-LLM Architecture

The UDM specifies a dual Large Language Model (LLM) architecture:

*   **Roo's Core Logic:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview is designated for Roo's (the autonomous system) core operational logic. This is referenced in UDM tasks such as `TASK-P0-M0.2-T006` (Research Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview).
*   **ClaudeBrowserMode:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 is specified for the `ClaudeBrowserMode` feature. This is referenced in UDM tasks such as `TASK-P0-M0.3-T016` (Research Claude Sonnet 3.5 for ClaudeBrowserMode).

## Core Framework: Genkit

Genkit is identified as a core framework for the project. This is explicitly mentioned in UDM task `TASK-P0-M0.5-T027` (Process Genkit Research Report), indicating its integral role in the system's development and operation.

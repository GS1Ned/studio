# **App Name**: Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA)

## Core Features:

- AI Document Q&A: Utilize a Gemini model to answer user questions about GS1 standards documents, acting as a smart tool. Provides a simplified and easily searchable summary of the current GS1 documentation. Incorporates Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy), Knowledge Graphs, Temporal Graph Learning, Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Formal Methods and Logic Programming, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), Explainable AI (XAI), Temporal Modeling and Time-Series Analysis, and Semantic Consistency Checking to achieve expert-level reasoning and analysis.
- Explainable Output Interface: Displays the extracted GS1 document information, reasoning steps (including symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning), AI confidence levels, and model evaluation metrics for expertise. Addresses the 'Faithfulness' problem in XAI to ensure explanations truly reflect internal reasoning.
- Document Parsing: Ingests GS1 documentation and prepares it for consumption by the AI. Handles dynamic knowledge by incorporating updates, tracking versions, and adapting to changes in the GS1 ecosystem using temporal graph learning and knowledge base evolution. Implements an enhanced ETLVRE (Extract, Transform, Load, Validate, Relate, Enrich) pipeline tailored for GS1, including GS1-centricity, semantic fidelity, temporal accuracy, rigorous validation, and continuous governance. This involves specialized connectors, advanced OCR/NLP, GS1 entity recognition, multi-layered validation, enrichment with temporal tags and relationship mapping, and a data value rating system.
- Intelligent Document Retrieval: RAG pipeline that feeds appropriate documents to the model based on the user's prompt. Ensures logical consistency at scale by balancing rigor with practicality in formal verification methods.
- User Prompt Input: Provides a text-based prompt box for users to input their questions.
- Standards Analysis: Analysis of existing standards (structure, semantics, inconsistencies)
- Standards Generation: Generation of new standards based on requirements
- Error Detection and Correction: Detection and correction of errors or overlapping definitions
- Automatic Documentation: Automatic documentation and explanation per standard rule
- Semantic Alignment: Semantic alignment between international versions of standards
- Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making: Contextual decision-making with human feedback (Human-in-the-loop)
- Natural Language to Formal Description: Transformation of natural language into formal standard descriptions
- Standard Linking: Linking standards to legislation and regulations or other domains
- Output Format Delivery: Being able to deliver any common output format, both chat and pdf, excel, csv, etc.
- Independent Research: Being able to conduct independent research to collect additional information in a targeted manner or formulate research questions aimed at collecting the right data and identifying the right sources.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to represent authority, intelligence, and clarity within a darker UI.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), almost black, providing a professional look and reducing eye strain.
- Accent color: Soft amber (#FFB300) as a clear contrast to the deep indigo, ideal for call-to-action elements, buttons and highlights.
- Clear, sans-serif fonts.
- Clean and modular layout that separates sections to keep information digestible and manageable.
- Crisp icons indicating the standards topic that each document belongs to. Avoid overwhelming detail; icons must remain clear even when small.

# Section 04: Roo Modes - Definitions & Interfaces

This section defines each specialized Roo development mode, its responsibilities, input/output contracts, and operational parameters. These modes are specialized cognitive functions of the Autonomous Supreme Architect, designed for optimal execution of specific task classes.

## 5.1. Mode: `ROO-MODE-BLUEPRINT`

-   **ID:** `ROO-MODE-BLUEPRINT`
-   **Purpose:** Master orchestrator, UDM parser, planner, dispatcher, validator. It is Roo's central "nervous system," following a 5-step execution loop to manage the entire development process.
-   **CorePromptReference:** [`/isa/prompts/master_architect_prompt_v2.0.prompt.txt`](isa/prompts/master_architect_prompt_v2.0.prompt.txt) (Blueprint Mode's core logic is embedded within the Master Prompt itself, as it is the primary orchestrator).
-   **Inputs:** UDM (all sections), current system state (`blueprint_state.json`), previous mode outputs.
-   **Outputs:** Task queue (`/state/roo_queue.json`), logs (`/logs/blueprint-mode.log`, `/logs/mode-handovers.md`), UDM updates.
-   **KeyToolsAndCapabilities:** UDM Parser, State Manager, Dispatcher, `UDMQueryTool`, `FileSystemAccessTool`.
-   **Operational Logic (5-Step Execution Loop):**
    1.  **Parse UDM Sections:** Roo reads and internalizes the UDM, building an in-memory model of its structure, content, and directives. This includes all sections from `00-UDM-Meta.md` to `11-Appendices.md`.
    2.  **Validate Current Context:** Roo verifies the current state of the ISA system and its own operational environment against the UDM and its last known state. This involves checking UDM integrity, roadmap task statuses, configuration drift, codebase state, resource availability, and internal tooling sanity.
    3.  **Generate Next Action Set:** Based on the validated context and the UDM Roadmap, Roo determines the next set of specific, actionable tasks. It prioritizes corrective actions if the context is invalid. It identifies tasks whose dependencies are met and formulates them into a structured queue (`/state/roo_queue.json`).
    4.  **Dispatch Execution to Next Mode:** Roo selects the appropriate specialized Roo Mode for the next task from the `roo_queue.json`. It prepares the necessary inputs and context for that mode and dispatches the task.
    5.  **Revalidate on Mode Return:** After a specialized mode completes its task, Roo receives the output and status. It validates the outcome against the task's `ExpectedOutputs` and `ValidationCriteria` defined in the UDM. It then updates the UDM (e.g., task statuses in the Roadmap) and its internal state (`blueprint_state.json`).
-   **SuccessMetrics:** UDM parsing accuracy, planning efficiency, successful task dispatch rate, cycle time, UDM consistency.
-   **ErrorHandling:** Robust error handling for UDM access, context validation failures, and task generation issues. Critical errors may lead to pausing operations or escalating for human review.
-   **EscalationPathways:** If core UDM integrity is compromised, or if no actionable tasks can be generated due to systemic issues, Roo escalates to a higher-level diagnostic or human review.

-   **Purpose:** To generate human-readable, accurate, and UDM-compliant textual documentation for specified UDM sections or topics. This mode takes a description of the required documentation (e.g., "Document Blueprint Mode's operational logic," "Explain the purpose of UDM Section 02.5," "Summarize findings from research report X for UDM Appendix Y") and synthesizes this into well-structured Markdown content. Its output (the generated Markdown text) is then passed to `ROO-MODE-UPDATE-UDM-TECHNICAL` for saving.

        -   `source_information_refs`: (Array of strings, optional) Paths to UDM sections, log files, audit reports, or external documents containing raw information.
        -   `udm_style_guide_ref`: (String, optional) Path to a (hypothetical) UDM section defining style, tone, formatting.
        -   `output_format_notes`: (String, optional) Specific instructions on Markdown structure.
        -   `audience_level_hint`: (String, optional, e.g., "technical_developer," "strategic_overview") Hint for target audience.
-   **KeyToolsAndCapabilities:** `UDMQueryTool`, Text Synthesis & Structuring (LLM-based), Markdown Formatting (LLM-based), Internal State Access (conceptual, for self-documentation).
-   **Outputs (The generated documentation content and a report):**
    -   **Primary Output:** `generated_markdown_content` (String), `target_udm_filepath_suggestion` (String), `target_section_identifier_suggestion` (String, optional), `update_type_suggestion` (Enum: "REPLACE_SECTION", "APPEND_TO_SECTION", "CREATE_SECTION_IF_NOT_EXISTS"). This package is passed to `ROO-MODE-UPDATE-UDM-TECHNICAL`.
    -   **Secondary Output:** A generation report file (e.g., `/logs/doc_generation/TASK-ID_doc_gen_report.md`) detailing: `task_id_processed`, `topic_documented`, `source_information_refs_used`, `key_points_covered_in_documentation`, difficulties encountered.
    -   **Status Report to Blueprint Mode:** `SUCCESS`, `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, or `FAILURE`.
-   **SuccessMetrics:** Clarity/accuracy/completeness of documentation, adherence to style, well-structured content, appropriate UDM placement suggestions.
-   **ErrorHandling:** Handles insufficient/ambiguous/conflicting source information.
-   **EscalationPathways:** Proposes new research tasks if information is insufficient. Escalates severe contradictions in UDM concepts to Blueprint Mode.

## 5.11. Mode: `ROO-MODE-VALIDATE-COMPLETION`

-   **ID:** `RM-VC01`
-   **Purpose:** To perform a comprehensive validation that a set of tasks, a Milestone, or an entire Project Phase has been successfully completed according to UDM criteria. This involves checking the status and validated outputs of all constituent tasks, ensuring all specified deliverables for the milestone/phase are present and correct, and verifying that all exit criteria are met. This mode acts as a quality gate before Roo (via Blueprint Mode) proceeds to subsequent stages of the roadmap.
-   **CorePromptReference:** [`/isa/prompts/roo_mode_validate_completion_prompt_v1.0.prompt.txt`](isa/prompts/roo_mode_validate_completion_prompt_v1.0.prompt.txt)
-   **Inputs (Standard Task Object from `roo_queue.json`, with `contextual_inputs` tailored for validation):**
    -   `task_id`: The unique ID for this validation task (e.g., T009 itself).
    -   `udm_task_reference`: Link to this task's definition in UDM `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`.
    -   `description`: A summary of the validation goal (e.g., "Validate completion of Milestone M0.1 & Phase 0 Exit Criteria").
    -   `contextual_inputs`:
        -   `target_milestone_id_to_validate`: (String) The ID of the Milestone whose completion is being validated.
        -   `target_phase_id_to_validate`: (String, optional) The ID of the Phase whose completion is being validated.
        -   `udm_roadmap_ref`: (String) Path to UDM Section `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md` to fetch task lists, statuses, and milestone/phase definitions.
        -   `all_task_logs_for_milestone_ref`: (String, optional) Path to the directory containing all individual task logs for the milestone.
        -   `blueprint_state_ref`: (String) Path to `blueprint_state.json` for cross-referencing current system state.
-   **KeyToolsAndCapabilities:** `UDMQueryTool`, `FileSystemAccessTool`, Log Parsing (conceptual), Comparison & Aggregation Logic (LLM-based).
-   **Outputs (A comprehensive validation report and UDM/state updates):**
    -   **Primary Output:** A "Milestone/Phase Completion Validation Report" (e.g., `/logs/milestones/MILESTONE-ID_PHASE-ID_completion_report.json` or `.md`) detailing: `task_id_processed`, `validated_milestone_id`, `validated_phase_id`, `overall_validation_status`, `task_validation_summary`, `milestone_exit_criteria_summary`, `phase_exit_criteria_summary`, `final_recommendation`.
    -   **Secondary Output (UDM & State Updates, performed by BlueprintMode *based on* this mode's recommendation if SUCCESS):** If `overall_validation_status` is "SUCCESS_ALL_CRITERIA_MET", Blueprint Mode will update UDM `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md` and `blueprint_state.json`.
    -   **Status Report to Blueprint Mode:** `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`.
-   **SuccessMetrics:** Comprehensive checking of tasks/criteria, thorough verification of deliverables, clarity/accuracy of report, correct determination of overall status.
-   **ErrorHandling:** Handles inaccessible UDM/logs, missing deliverables, ambiguous criteria.
-   **EscalationPathways:** If validation fails, Blueprint Mode receives the report and decides on corrective actions (re-queue, new tasks, human review). Escalates systemic issues.

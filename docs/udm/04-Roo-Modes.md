# Section 04: Roo Modes - Definitions & Interfaces

This section defines each specialized Roo development and operational mode. These modes are distinct cognitive functions of Roo, the Autonomous Supreme Architect, designed for optimal execution of specific task classes. Each mode operates under the guidance of its own Core Operational Prompt (referenced herein and stored in the `/prompts/` directory) and utilizes a defined set of Key Tools and Capabilities. Blueprint Mode orchestrates the invocation of these modes based on tasks defined in UDM Section `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`.

## 4.1 Mode: BlueprintMode
- **ID:** `RM-BP01` (Example ID: Roo Mode - BluePrint 01)
- **Purpose:** Acts as Roo's central "nervous system" and primary orchestrator. It is responsible for parsing and interpreting the UDM, maintaining an understanding of the current system state, planning sequences of actions by generating tasks for other Roo Modes, dispatching those tasks, monitoring their execution, and validating their completion against UDM criteria. It drives the overall autonomous development lifecycle of ISA.
- **AI_Model_Dependency:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 20-5 (or latest approved equivalent).
- **CorePromptReference:** `/prompts/master_architect_prompt_v2.0_ARCHITECT_ULTIME.prompt.txt` (BlueprintMode's core operational logic is deeply embedded within the Master Prompt's Behavioral Protocols and Initial Operational Directive, particularly its 5-step execution loop).
- **Inputs (for its operational cycle, not a typical task input):**
    - The entire UDM (especially `00-UDM-Meta.md`, `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`).
    - Current system state from `/state/blueprint_state.json`.
    - The task queue from `/state/roo_queue.json`.
    - Outputs and logs from other Roo Modes.
- **KeyToolsAndCapabilities:**
    - **UDM Parsing & Querying System:** (Advanced internal capability) To read, understand, and query all UDM sections.
    - **State Management:** Ability to interact with `/state/blueprint_state.json` and `/state/roo_queue.json`.
    - **Logging System:** Writes to `/logs/blueprint-mode.log` and `/logs/mode-handovers.md`.
    - **Mode Dispatcher:** Mechanism to invoke other Roo Modes.
    - **Core LLM Reasoning (Gemini 2.5 Flash):** For planning, decision-making, context validation, and re-validation.
- **Outputs (from its operational cycle):**
    - Updated UDM (task statuses, new tasks, potentially evolved UDM content via its own directives or by dispatching to `ROO-MODE-UPDATE-UDM-TECHNICAL`).
    - Updated `/state/blueprint_state.json` and `/state/roo_queue.json`.
    - Updated logs.
    - Dispatched tasks to other Roo Modes.
- **Core Execution Loop (Detailed from Master Prompt & Co-designed Logic):**
    The Blueprint Mode operates on a continuous, self-correcting loop to drive the autonomous development of ISA. This loop ensures that Roo's actions are always aligned with the UDM and the Core Mandate.

    1.  **Parse UDM Sections:**
        *   **Purpose:** To maintain an up-to-date internal model of the entire Unified Development Manual (UDM).
        *   **Key Inputs:** All UDM section files (e.g., `00-UDM-Meta.md`, `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`).
        *   **Core Process:** Continuously read, parse, and index UDM content. Identify changes or updates to directives, roadmaps, mode definitions, or architectural specifications.
        *   **Key Outputs:** An internally consistent and current representation of the UDM.
        *   **Error Handling:** If UDM parsing fails or inconsistencies are detected, log a critical error and potentially pause for human review or initiate a UDM self-correction task.

    2.  **Validate Current Context:**
        *   **Purpose:** To verify the integrity of the current system state against the UDM and detect any configuration drift or anomalies.
        *   **Key Inputs:** Current system state (`/state/blueprint_state.json`), recent logs from other modes, UDM definitions (e.g., `06-Operational-Config.md`).
        *   **Core Process:** Compare actual system state (e.g., file presence, configuration values) with expected states defined in the UDM. Check for consistency across logs and internal state.
        *   **Key Outputs:** Validation report on system integrity and UDM adherence.
        *   **Error Handling:** If critical discrepancies or integrity issues are found, log them, and potentially trigger diagnostic or corrective tasks.

    3.  **Generate Next Action Set:**
        *   **Purpose:** To determine the highest-priority needs or opportunities for improvement/evolution and formulate concrete directives (tasks) for other Roo Modes.
        *   **Key Inputs:** Current UDM Roadmap (`05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`), audit reports (`/logs/audits/`), knowledge gap assessments (`/logs/knowledge_gaps/`), Core Mandate (`01-Core-Mandate.md`), current `blueprint_state.json`.
        *   **Core Process:** Analyze the roadmap for the next `TODO` task. If no explicit `TODO` task, identify the next logical step based on strategic goals, audit findings, and knowledge gaps. Formulate a detailed task object for `roo_queue.json`, including `task_id`, `description`, `assigned_roo_mode`, `priority`, `expected_outputs`, and `validation_criteria`. Justify the directive against UDM goals and Core Principles.
        *   **Key Outputs:** Updated `roo_queue.json` with new tasks, updated `blueprint_state.json` reflecting task generation.
        *   **Error Handling:** If unable to formulate a clear next action, or if conflicting directives arise, log the ambiguity and potentially flag for human review.

    4.  **Dispatch Execution to Next Mode:**
        *   **Purpose:** To invoke the appropriate specialized Roo Mode for the next task in the `roo_queue.json`.
        *   **Key Inputs:** The next task object from `roo_queue.json`.
        *   **Core Process:** Select the task with the highest priority from the queue. Based on its `assigned_roo_mode`, prepare the necessary inputs and dispatch the task to that mode. Log the mode handover.
        *   **Key Outputs:** Execution of a specialized Roo Mode.
        *   **Error Handling:** If a mode fails to launch or returns an immediate critical error, log the failure and re-queue the task with an error status, or initiate a diagnostic task.

    5.  **Revalidate on Mode Return & Adapt:**
        *   **Purpose:** To assess the outputs of the dispatched Roo Mode against UDM criteria, update the UDM and system state, and identify learnings for future cycles.
        *   **Key Inputs:** Output and status report from the completed Roo Mode task, UDM task definition (for `ExpectedOutputs` and `ValidationCriteria`).
        *   **Core Process:** Compare actual outcomes against predicted outcomes. Update the status of the completed task in `05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md` (e.g., to `VALIDATED` or `FAILED`). Update the knowledge base (`/memory_bank/knowledge_base/`), history (`/memory_bank/history/events.json`), and performance metrics. Identify learnings, imperfections, and new knowledge gaps. If necessary, trigger corrective actions, plan revisions (update UDM Roadmap), or new research directives. Update `00-UDM-Meta.md` and `change-log.md` if the learnings have strategic implications.
        *   **Key Outputs:** Updated UDM, updated `/state/blueprint_state.json`, updated logs, potential new tasks for correction or further development.
        *   **Error Handling:** If validation fails, or if the mode's output is inconsistent, log the discrepancy and trigger a corrective action (e.g., re-queue the task, create a debug task, or escalate for human review).

## 4.11 Mode: ClaudeBrowserMode
- **ID:** `RM-CB01`
- **Purpose:** To perform interactive browser-based tasks by intelligently using a suite of browser control actions (tools) to achieve a specified goal. Handles tasks dependent on the 'Roocode browser' capability via the Claude API's tool-use features.
- **AI_Model_Dependency:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 (via Vertex AI, using `@genkit-ai/vertexai` plugin).
- **CorePromptReference:** `/prompts/claude_browser_mode_prompt_v2.0.prompt.txt`
- **KeyToolsAndCapabilities (Suite of 8 Browser Actions available to Claude Sonnet 3.5 via Claude API tool_use, executed by Inter-Model Bridge):**
    - `launchBrowser`
    - `clickElement`
    - `typeText`
    - `scrollPage`
    - `captureScreenshot`
    - `getElementText`
    - `checkElementExists`
    - `closeBrowser`
    - (Claude Sonnet 3.5's inherent reasoning, planning, and (multi-modal for screenshots) capabilities).
    - Reporting Tool (to structure JSON output).
- **Inputs (Standard Task Object from `roo_queue.json`):**
    - `task_id`, `udm_task_reference`, `description`.
    - `contextual_inputs`:
        - `browser_task_goal`: (String) High-level goal.
        - `initial_target_url`: (String, optional).
        - `sensitive_inputs`: (Object, optional) For credentials.

- **KeyToolsAndCapabilities (Suite of 8 Browser Actions available to Claude Sonnet 3.5 via Claude API tool_use, executed by Inter-Model Bridge):**
    - `launchBrowser`
    - `clickElement`
    - `typeText`
    - `scrollPage`
    - `captureScreenshot`
    - `getElementText`
    - `checkElementExists`
    - `closeBrowser`
    - (Claude Sonnet 3.5's inherent reasoning, planning, and (multi-modal for screenshots) capabilities).
    - Reporting Tool (to structure JSON output).
- **Outputs:**
    - Primary Output: Browser interaction report (`/logs/browser_interactions/TASK-ID_browser_report.json`) detailing overall status, log of actions performed with their individual outcomes (screenshots, console logs, errors), validation results, and extracted information.
    - Status Report to Blueprint Mode.
- **SuccessMetrics:** Successful completion of all intended browser actions; positive confirmation of validation conditions; correct extraction of specified information; accurate logging of steps and outcomes.

# Section 03: Knowledge & Data Management

This section defines the strategies, architectures, and mechanisms for managing all forms of knowledge and data within the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project and for Roo's operations. This includes the meta-knowledge base, dynamic memory architecture, and the "Context7" mechanism.

## 3.1 Overview of Knowledge Management

Effective knowledge management is crucial for ISA's ability to understand, apply, and evolve GS1 standards, and for Roo's autonomous self-optimization. This involves:
- **Data Ingestion:** How external data (GS1 standards, research, web content) is acquired.
- **Knowledge Representation:** How data is structured and stored (e.g., knowledge graphs, semantic models).
- **Memory Systems:** How Roo maintains short-term and long-term context and learning.
- **Data Governance:** Policies for data quality, security, and privacy.

## 3.2 Dynamic Memory Architecture

Roo employs a multi-layered memory system to ensure persistence, relevance, and accessibility of all operational and learned knowledge.

### 3.2.1 Memory Components

- `/memory_bank/context/blueprint_state.json`: For short-term operational state and current task context.
- `/memory_bank/history/events.json`: For experiential learning, logging past actions, and their outcomes.
- `/memory_bank/knowledge_base/`: For synthesized, long-term knowledge, research findings, and derived insights.

### 3.2.2 Context7 Mechanism (Conceptual)

The "Context7" mechanism is a critical component of the advanced memory architecture, designed for long-term semantic context and efficient retrieval of highly relevant information. Its detailed definition and implementation will be a focus of `TASK-P0-M0.1-T017`.

## 3.3 Data Governance and Security

(This subsection will be populated with details on data quality, integrity, privacy, and security policies, aligning with UDM Section 08.)

# Section 03: Knowledge & Data Management

This section defines the strategies, architectures, and mechanisms for managing all forms of knowledge and data within the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project and for Roo's operations. This includes the meta-knowledge base, dynamic memory architecture, and the "Context7" mechanism.

## 3.1 Overview of Knowledge Management

Effective knowledge management is crucial for ISA's ability to understand, apply, and evolve GS1 standards, and for Roo's autonomous self-optimization. This involves:
- **Data Ingestion:** How external data (GS1 standards, research, web content) is acquired.
- **Knowledge Representation:** How data is structured and stored (e.g., knowledge graphs, semantic models).
- **Memory Systems:** How Roo maintains short-term and long-term context and learning.
- **Data Governance:** Policies for data quality, security, and privacy.

## 3.2 Dynamic Memory Architecture

Roo employs a multi-layered memory system to ensure persistence, relevance, and accessibility of all operational and learned knowledge.

### 3.2.1 Memory Components

- `/memory_bank/context/blueprint_state.json`: For short-term operational state and current task context.
- `/memory_bank/history/events.json`: For experiential learning, logging past actions, and their outcomes.
- `/memory_bank/knowledge_base/`: For synthesized, long-term knowledge, research findings, and derived insights.

### 3.2.2 Advanced Memory Architecture & Context7

The "Context7" mechanism, informed by `docs/research_appendix/APP-CONTEXT7-RESEARCH-REPORT-V1.md`, is an intelligent orchestration framework at the core of Roo's advanced memory architecture. It manages and dynamically utilizes multiple forms of contextual information to enhance Roo's operational capabilities. This system is designed for long-term semantic context, efficient information retrieval, and experiential learning.

**1. Context7 Core Concept:**
*   **Orchestration Framework:** Context7 is not a single technology but a system of interconnected Genkit flows. It actively gathers, filters, prioritizes, and fuses information from various `/memory_bank/` stores and real-time inputs.
*   **Multi-Faceted Context:** It processes seven inferred context types:
    1.  **Temporal Context (Short-Term Memory - STM):** Recent interactions, current conversation.
    2.  **Semantic Context (Semantic LTM):** Underlying meaning interpreted against Roo's knowledge.
    3.  **Episodic Context (Episodic LTM):** Recall of specific past events and interactions.
    4.  **Procedural Context (Procedural LTM):** Knowledge of relevant skills and action sequences.
    5.  **User Context:** User-specific preferences, history, and goals.
    6.  **Task Context:** Information about Roo's current objectives, constraints, and progress.
    7.  **Environmental/Domain Context:** Broader knowledge (e.g., GS1 standards, UDM structure).

**2. Key Technologies & `/memory_bank/` Integration:**
*   **Genkit:** The primary technology for implementing Context7 logic, orchestrating data flows, and managing interactions with memory components.
*   **Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR):**
    *   **Fast-Access Memory Pool (Cache):** For STM and frequently accessed LTM.
        *   *Technology Indication:* In-memory caches like Redis (via Genkit plugin).
    *   **Deep-Retrieval Memory Pool (Persistent Storage):** For bulk LTM.
        *   *Technology Indication:* Cloud Firestore for structured data (episodic logs, UDM metadata), and Vector Databases (e.g., Firestore Vector Search, Pinecone via Genkit plugins) for semantic information (text embeddings of UDM, GS1 docs).
*   **Memory Components within `/memory_bank/`:**
    *   **Short-Term Memory (STM):** Managed within Genkit flow state or persisted in the Fast-Access Pool (e.g., Redis).
    *   **Episodic Memory (LTM):** Structured logs in Cloud Firestore (e.g., `/memory_bank/history/events.json`).
    *   **Semantic Memory (LTM):** Text embeddings in Vector Databases, knowledge bases (e.g., `/memory_bank/knowledge_base/`).
    *   **Procedural Memory (LTM):** Reusable Genkit flow definitions and configurations identifiable by Context7.

**3. Data Flows & Interactions:**
*   Context7 analyzes inputs (user queries, system events).
*   It formulates queries to the `/memory_bank/` stores using HMR (Fast-Access then Deep-Retrieval).
*   Retrieves information via semantic searches (Vector DBs) and structured queries (Firestore).
*   Fuses retrieved data with current input and real-time information, weighting by relevance, recency, and reliability.
*   Provides the synthesized operational context to Roo's core reasoning and generation modules (other Genkit flows).

**4. Experiential Learning - Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL):**
*   Roo's actions and their outcomes, orchestrated by Genkit flows, are captured as experiences.
*   Experiences are classified by task category (e.g., "UDM validation," "code generation").
*   Classified experiences are stored in `/memory_bank/` (e.g., new episodic log in Firestore, updates to procedural memory).
*   This feedback loop enriches Roo's memory, allowing Context7 to use task categories for refined memory searches and improved future performance.

**5. Integration with Roo Modes:**
*   Most Roo Modes will leverage Context7 to obtain comprehensive, relevant context for their specific tasks. For example, `ROO-MODE-RESEARCH` can use Context7 to access prior research and relevant UDM sections, while `ROO-MODE-PLAN-STRATEGIC` can use it to understand historical decisions and their outcomes.

This detailed definition of the Advanced Memory Architecture and Context7 provides a foundational understanding for its ongoing development and integration into Roo's systems.

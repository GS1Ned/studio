# Section 07: Testing & Quality Assurance

This section outlines the testing frameworks, strategies, and quality assurance protocols for the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) and Roo's operations. It will be expanded significantly as the project matures and specific testing needs for AI components become clearer, incorporating insights from `APP-GENKIT-RESEARCH-REPORT-V1.md`.

## 7.1 Testing Philosophy

(This subsection will define the overall testing philosophy, including unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance testing approaches for both traditional code and AI-driven Genkit flows.)

Key considerations, reinforced by Genkit practices, include:
- **Data Quality for AI:** Ensuring the quality, representativeness, and lack of bias in data used for training (if applicable) or evaluating AI models and Genkit flows.
- **Model & Flow Performance:** Rigorously testing for accuracy, relevance, coherence, factual correctness, safety, and robustness of AI-generated outputs and flow outcomes.
- **Ethical & Safety Testing:** Probing for biases, harmful content generation, and adherence to safety protocols, potentially using Genkit evaluators.
- **"Living Test Suites":** Developing test suites that can co-evolve with an autonomously developing system like ISA. This may involve Roo itself participating in test case generation or updates, a concept compatible with Genkit's programmatic testing APIs.
- **Iterative Evaluation:** Continuously evaluating flows and models as they evolve.

## 7.2 Genkit Flow Testing & Evaluation

Genkit provides a comprehensive suite of tools and patterns that are central to ISA's testing strategy for AI-driven components, as detailed in `APP-GENKIT-RESEARCH-REPORT-V1.md` (Sections 6 & 9).

- **Local Testing of Flows:**
    - **Genkit CLI:** Flows can be invoked, run, and tested locally using the Genkit CLI, facilitating rapid iteration during development.
    - **Programmatic Invocation:** Flows, being TypeScript functions, can be imported and called directly in standard testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest). This allows for fine-grained unit and integration tests, including mocking dependencies or tools.
- **Genkit `evaluate` Command & APIs:**
    - **Purpose:** Genkit offers an `evaluate` command and associated APIs to systematically run flows against predefined datasets (test cases) and assess their outputs using various evaluators.
    - **Datasets:** Test cases can be defined in JSON or other structured formats, enabling thorough testing of diverse scenarios, inputs, and edge cases.
    - **Evaluators:**
        - **Built-in Evaluators:** Genkit may offer evaluators for common metrics (e.g., toxicity, faithfulness against a context).
        - **Custom Evaluators:** ISA can develop custom evaluators to check for adherence to specific UDM rules, output formatting, factual correctness against GS1 standards, or other project-specific criteria. These evaluators can be JavaScript/TypeScript functions.
        - **LLM-as-Judge:** Use another LLM (potentially via a Genkit flow) to evaluate the quality, coherence, or safety of a flow's output.
- **Observability for Testing & Debugging:**
    - **Genkit Developer UI (Local):** Provides local tracing of flow execution, allowing developers to inspect inputs, outputs, intermediate steps, and tool calls. This is invaluable for debugging both flows and their tests.
    - **Firebase Genkit Monitoring (Production & Staging):** When deployed, telemetry (traces, metrics, logs) sent to Google Cloud Operations Suite (Cloud Logging, Cloud Trace, Cloud Monitoring) can be used to analyze test runs in staging environments, identify performance regressions, or debug issues found in more complex integration tests.
- **Integration with CI/CD:**
    - Automated execution of all Genkit flow tests (unit/integration tests via Jest/Vitest, and evaluations using `genkit evaluate`) MUST be integrated into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This ensures that any changes to flows, underlying models, or tools are validated before deployment to production or even staging environments.

## 7.3 Quality Assurance Protocols

(This subsection will detail code review processes, static analysis, UDM validation checks, and other quality gates for both human-written and Roo-generated code/UDM content.)

## 7.4 Metrics for Quality

(This subsection will define quantitative and qualitative metrics for code quality, architectural integrity, system performance, AI model/flow quality, and UDM consistency, as referenced in the Master Prompt.)

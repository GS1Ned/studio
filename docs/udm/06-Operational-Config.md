# Section 06: Operational Configuration

This section defines the operational configurations for the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) across various environments (development, staging, production). It also includes best practices, security guidelines, and performance optimizations related to configuration management.

## 6.1 Current Project Configuration Audit (TASK-P0-M0.1-T001)

This subsection documents the initial audit findings for key project configuration files as part of Milestone M0.1, Task T001.

### 6.1.1 `apphosting.yaml`

**Current State (Placeholder):**
```yaml
# This is a placeholder for Google Cloud App Hosting configuration.
# Further configuration will be added based on audit findings and deployment needs.
# Example minimal configuration:
# service: default
# regions:
#   - us-central1
#   - us-east1
# memoryMiB: 512 # This is a known discrepancy from initial human review, will be audited.
```

**Findings:**
- **Issue:** File is a placeholder with no active configuration.
- **Risk Level:** Informational
- **Recommendation:** Populate with actual Google Cloud App Hosting configuration based on project requirements. Review `memoryMiB` value against actual application needs and cost optimization.

### 6.1.2 `firebase.json`

**Current State (Minimal Hosting):**
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Findings:**
- **Issue:** Minimal configuration, lacks definitions for other Firebase services (Functions, Firestore, Storage, etc.) that might be used by ISA.
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Recommendation:** Expand `firebase.json` to include configurations for all Firebase services utilized by the ISA project, ensuring security rules and deployment settings are optimized.

### 6.1.3 `next.config.ts`

**Current State (Basic Next.js with ESLint override):**
```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next';

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  eslint: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

**Findings:**
- **Issue:** `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors` is set to `true`, which allows production builds to complete even with ESLint errors. This compromises code quality and consistency.
- **UDM Reference Violated:** Master Prompt: 'obsessively driven to eliminate all forms of ambiguity, inconsistency, and sub-optimality'
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Recommendation:** Set `eslint.ignoreBuildErrors` to `false` once initial setup is complete and all ESLint errors are resolved. Implement a robust linting process to ensure code quality.

### 6.1.4 `package.json`

**Current State (Basic Next.js dependencies):**
```json
{
  "name": "isa-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "14.2.3",
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.2.3",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

**Findings:**
- **Issue:** Dependencies are minimal and may not reflect all actual project needs (e.g., Genkit, Firebase SDKs).
- **Risk Level:** Informational
- **Recommendation:** Review and update dependencies to include all necessary libraries for ISA's functionality (e.g., Genkit, Firebase Admin/Client SDKs, Zod for schema validation, etc.). Ensure dependency versions are managed to prevent conflicts and security vulnerabilities.

### 6.1.5 `tsconfig.json`

**Current State (Standard TypeScript config):**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

**Findings:**
- **Issue:** No immediate issues identified. Configuration aligns with best practices.
- **Risk Level:** None
- **Recommendation:** Maintain `strict: true` and other quality-focused compiler options. Ensure `include` and `exclude` paths accurately reflect the project structure as it evolves.

## 6.2 AI Model Configuration

### 6.2.1 Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 20-5 Configuration

The primary AI model used by Roo and ISA is Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 20-5. Its configuration within the Genkit framework will be managed here.

**Conceptual Genkit Configuration (Example):**
```typescript
import { configureGenkit } from '@genkit-ai/core';
import { geminiPro } from '@genkit-ai/google-cloud'; // Or specific Gemini Flash import

configureGenkit({
  plugins: [
    geminiPro({
      projectId: 'your-gcp-project-id', // To be configured
      location: 'us-central1', // To be configured
    }),
    // Other plugins for tools (e.g., fileSystemAccessTool, webSearchTool)
  ],
  // Other Genkit configuration options
});
```

**Findings & Implications:**
- **Model Choice:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 20-5 is selected for its speed and cost-effectiveness, suitable for rapid iteration and general reasoning tasks.
- **Knowledge Gap:** Specific `projectId` and `location` for Genkit configuration need to be defined.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure secure management of GCP project IDs and API keys. Monitor model performance and cost, and be prepared to adapt to newer model versions or alternative models if required by performance or cost metrics.

# Section 09: Evolution Protocol

This section defines the protocols and procedures for the continuous evolution of both the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) system and the Unified Development Manual (UDM) itself. This includes mechanisms for proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes, as well as handling critical issues and human intervention points.

## 9.1 UDM Evolution Process

(This subsection will detail how the UDM is updated, including versioning, change logging, and approval mechanisms.)

## 9.2 System Evolution and Upgrade Paths

(This subsection will outline how ISA components are updated, refactored, and upgraded, ensuring minimal disruption and continuous improvement.)

## 9.3 Critical Issue Handling and Escalation

(This subsection will define protocols for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving critical issues, including when and how to escalate for human review or intervention.)

## 9.4 Integration of New Knowledge and Technologies

(This subsection will describe the process for integrating new GS1 standards, research findings, and disruptive technologies into ISA and the UDM.)

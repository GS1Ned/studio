# 📁 docs/archive

This directory contains deprecated or historical documentation from earlier phases of the project. Move outdated files here so the main `docs/` folder stays focused on active content.

## Usage guidelines
- Treat these files as reference-only; scan for any credentials before committing.
- Large or obsolete materials can be moved into `docs/archive-bin/`.
- If you archive a document, note why it was moved or link to a replacement when possible.

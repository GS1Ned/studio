🎯 ROLE:
You are Codex, acting as an expert technical auditor and roadmap alignment assistant for the GS1 ISA project.

📍 REPOSITORY UNDER REVIEW:
🔗 https://github.com/GS1Ned/studio/tree/main-6-juni

🧭 OBJECTIVE:
Evaluate the current folder and file structure in the repository against the **official ISA Development Roadmap** and determine:

1. Which files/folders align with specific roadmap phases
2. Which are premature (i.e. belong to future phases not yet underway)
3. Which are misplaced or redundant
4. Whether the current layout reflects the current roadmap stage (Epochs 1–2)

🧠 WHAT YOU MUST DO:
    1.  Traverse all files and folders in the main-6-juni branch.
    2.  Assign each core file or folder to a roadmap phase if applicable.
    3.  Flag any premature or not-yet-relevant folders.
    4.  Suggest correct destinations for misplaced files.
    5.  Summarize overall alignment with the roadmap.

✅ FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE LIKE THIS:

## Repository Phase Mapping

### ✅ Matched to Roadmap
- `/docs/blueprint.md` → Phase 4: Self-Healing Docs
- `/src/ai/dev.ts` → Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### ⚠️ Premature (Not Active Yet)
- `/src/agents/autonomy/` → Phase 14: Autonomous Knowledge
- `/dao/structure/` → Phase 18: DAO Governance

### ❌ Misplaced or Unstructured
- `response.md` → Should be moved to `/docs/notes/`
- `.modified` → Remove (empty file)
- `technical_report.md` → Move to `/docs/`

## Summary
Current roadmap phase: Epochs 1–2
- ✅ Core structure aligns well
- 🧹 Cleanup of premature/misplaced folders advised
- 📘 Consider updating `blueprint.md` with roadmap-based folder-phase mapping

If a file or folder doesn’t match anything in the roadmap, state “Unmapped” and explain your reasoning

# Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) Project

This repository houses the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA), an evolving, sentient-level intelligent super-application dedicated to the comprehensive understanding, application, and strategic evolution of GS1 standards and related knowledge domains.

## Project Overview

The ISA project is autonomously developed and maintained by Roo, the Autonomous Supreme Architect, guided by the Unified Development Manual (UDM). The UDM serves as the single source of truth for all technical, architectural, operational, and procedural elements of this project.

## Getting Started

Currently, this project is in its initial setup phase. The core application codebase is not yet implemented.

### Key Project Files:

- `docs/`: Contains the Unified Development Manual (UDM) and research appendices.
- `prompts/`: Stores the core prompts that define Roo's operational modes.
- `logs/`: Stores operational logs, audit reports, and research findings.
- `state/`: Contains Roo's internal operational state.
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `firebase.json`, `apphosting.yaml`: Core configuration files for the Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase/Google Cloud App Hosting environment.

## Development Status

This project is under active autonomous development by Roo. Refer to the UDM (`docs/udm/05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`) for the latest strategic roadmap and task progress.

## Contribution

(Contribution guidelines will be defined in the UDM as the project matures.)

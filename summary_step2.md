# Project Progress and Identified Issues Summary

## Key Achievements (Phase 0 - Systemic Actualization)

Phase 0, "Systemic Actualization," has reportedly achieved several key milestones:

*   **Unified Development Manual (UDM) Population:** A significant portion of the UDM has been populated, providing a foundational guide for development.
*   **Roo's Operational Modes Defined:** The different operational modes for Roo, the autonomous developing system, have been defined.
*   **5-Cycle Strategic Roadmap Formulated:** A strategic roadmap consisting of 5 cycles has been formulated, outlining the long-term development plan.

## Identified Issues

Several issues have been identified:

1.  **Task Status Discrepancy:**
    *   Milestone `MILESTONE-P0-M0.1` and `PHASE-0` itself are marked as `VALIDATED` (reportedly by task `T009`).
    *   However, a significant number of sub-tasks within Phase 0 (e.g., T010, T013-T017, T019-T032, and others) are still listed as `TODO` in the `docs/udm/05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`.
    *   This discrepancy suggests a potential flaw in the validation process for `T009` or an issue with the accuracy of task status tracking within the UDM.

2.  **`apphosting.yaml` Memory Configuration:**
    *   The `apphosting.yaml` file contains a `memoryMiB: 512` setting, which has been noted as a potential issue or requiring review.
    *   Task `TASK-P0-M0.1-T001`, responsible for auditing configuration files, is marked as `VALIDATED`.
    *   This validation implies that the memory configuration should have been addressed, or its status (e.g., accepted, deferred, flagged for future action) should be documented either in UDM Section 06 (Operational Config) or within the audit report associated with task `T001`. The current state indicates a potential oversight.

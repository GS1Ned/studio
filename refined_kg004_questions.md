# Targeted Research Questions for KG-004: Operational Protocols and Standards (Firebase Focus)

## Targeted Question 4.1 (AI Testing & QA in Firebase/Genkit)

*   What specific strategies, tools, and Firebase-compatible frameworks are most effective for implementing "living test suites" for ISA, focusing on:
    *   Testing Genkit flows deployed on Firebase Cloud Functions (unit, integration, regression).
    *   Validating the integrity and performance of the Context7 memory system (interactions between Firestore, Firestore Vector Search, and Redis cache).
    *   Automating parts of the test lifecycle for an autonomously evolving system.
*   How can Roo, as a system of Genkit flows running on Firebase Cloud Functions, be designed to actively participate in its own QA process? This includes:
    *   Generating new test cases for its self-modified code or UDM sections, potentially storing these test cases in Firestore.
    *   Interpreting UDM-defined test specifications (if parts of the UDM detailing test requirements are stored in Firestore) and executing corresponding tests.
    *   Learning from production failures (logged in Cloud Logging or Firestore) to automatically create new regression tests.
*   How can Firebase Genkit Monitoring, Cloud Logging, and other GCP observability tools be optimally configured and utilized for:
    *   Continuous QA of ISA's Genkit flows and AI models.
    *   Early detection of model drift or performance degradation in AI components.
    *   Monitoring the health and effectiveness of the Context7 memory system.
    *   Providing actionable insights for both human developers and Roo's self-correction mechanisms?

## Targeted Question 4.2 (Ethical Guardrails & UDM as Conscience in Firebase)

*   How can ethical guidelines and constraints, formally defined and embedded within specific UDM sections (which might be stored as structured documents in Firestore), be actively, efficiently, and verifiably consulted by Roo's Genkit flows (running as Firebase Cloud Functions) before critical actions are taken (e.g., before Roo modifies the UDM stored in Firestore, interprets sensitive GS1 data, or generates new code)?
    *   What query patterns or data structures in Firestore would allow rapid retrieval of relevant ethical rules by a Genkit flow?
*   What technical mechanisms within the Firebase ecosystem can support the robust enforcement of these UDM-defined ethical guardrails? For example:
    *   Can Firestore security rules be designed with logic to prevent writes that violate certain UDM-encoded ethical constraints?
    *   Could specific "ethical review" Cloud Functions be designed as mandatory checkpoints in critical Genkit flows, where these functions consult the UDM in Firestore?
    *   How can Firebase Authentication custom claims or roles be used to enforce different levels of ethical oversight or restrict Roo's capabilities based on the sensitivity of an operation?
*   How can we design and implement a comprehensive and immutable audit trail within Firebase (e.g., using dedicated Firestore collections with restrictive write rules, or by streaming audit data to Cloud Logging/BigQuery) that specifically records:
    *   Instances where Roo's Genkit flows consulted UDM ethical guidelines from Firestore.
    *   The specific guidelines retrieved.
    *   The outcome of the ethical check (e.g., proceeding, modifying action, halting action).
    *   Any human overrides or interventions related to ethical considerations?

## Targeted Question 4.3 (UDM Evolution & Governance with Firebase)

*   What are the best practices for versioning the UDM itself, ensuring integrity, auditability, and rollback capabilities, particularly when significant parts of the UDM (e.g., structured data, configurations, specific sections like ethical rules) are stored and managed as documents or collections within Cloud Firestore?
    *   How can Firestore's existing capabilities (e.g., document history, if applicable, or custom versioning schemes) be leveraged?
    *   Should UDM versions be immutable in Firestore, or how are changes tracked?
*   How can secure and abstracted UDM manipulation (read, write, structural modification of UDM sections) by Roo be implemented using Genkit tools/flows when the UDM data is primarily stored in Firestore?
    *   What specific Firebase security rules are needed to grant Roo (via its Cloud Function service accounts) precise, least-privilege access to modify only designated UDM sections in Firestore?
    *   How can these Genkit tools ensure atomicity or consistency if a single logical UDM change requires modifications to multiple documents in Firestore?
    *   If parts of the UDM are in Git and synced to Firebase (e.g., via Firebase Storage for large files or Cloud Functions for processing), how does Roo securely interact with this sync process?
*   What automated validation processes, implementable within the Firebase environment, can support the safe and consistent autonomous evolution of the UDM by Roo? For example:
    *   Cloud Functions triggered by writes to UDM sections in Firestore, performing schema validation against a master UDM schema (also potentially in Firestore).
    *   Cloud Functions that perform UDM-code consistency checks (e.g., ensuring a UDM change made by Roo in Firestore is reflected in a corresponding (sandboxed) code change proposal).
    *   How can Firebase App Check be used to ensure that only authorized instances of Roo (its Cloud Functions) can make modifications to the UDM in Firestore?

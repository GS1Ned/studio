# Identified Research Needs

This document outlines key areas requiring further research, definition, and implementation for the successful development of the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) by Roo. These needs are categorized based on their scope and urgency.

## I. Foundational Research & Core Architecture Needs

*   **Roo's Core Logic & Self-Correction (Cycle 1 - Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview):**
    *   Define mechanisms for Roo to autonomously manage and correct its codebase and operational parameters.
    *   Research best practices for implementing self-correction loops using LLMs.
    *   Establish protocols for how Roo interacts with and updates the UDM based on its learning.
*   **Knowledge Graph Implementation (Cycle 2):**
    *   Research and select appropriate technologies/methodologies for building and maintaining the ISA's knowledge graph.
    *   Define the schema and data ingestion pipelines for populating the graph with standards, regulations, and related documentation.
*   **Advanced Intelligence & Self-Optimization (Cycle 3):**
    *   Explore techniques for advanced reasoning, inference, and explainability for the ISA.
    *   Investigate self-optimization strategies for Roo's performance and resource utilization.

    *   Define how Roo will manage its own source code versions, branching, and merging, especially during self-correction.
    *   (Corresponds to UDM Task `TASK-P0-M0.1-T003`, which is `VALIDATED` but may need deeper research for autonomous operation)

## III. ISA Core Functionality (Longer-Term Research for Cycles 2-5)

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Standards Interpretation (Cycle 2):**
    *   Research advanced NLP techniques for accurately parsing, interpreting, and summarizing complex regulatory texts.
*   **Cross-Standard Referencing & Gap Analysis (Cycle 2):**
    *   Develop methodologies for identifying relationships, conflicts, and gaps between different standards.
*   **User Query Understanding & Disambiguation (Cycle 2):**
    *   Research techniques for robustly understanding user queries related to standards and compliance.
*   **Report Generation & Evidence Collation (Cycle 2-3):**
    *   Define how ISA will generate compliance reports and collate evidence.

## IV. Pending Configurations & Operational Management

*   **`apphosting.yaml` Finalization (Cycle 1 / Immediate):**
    *   Resolve the `memoryMiB: 512` placeholder and determine appropriate resource allocation.
    *   Ensure the configuration aligns with deployment best practices for Next.js on Firebase/Google Cloud App Hosting.
    *   (Relates to UDM Task `TASK-P0-M0.1-T001`, which is `VALIDATED` but the issue persists)
*   **Firebase Project Setup & Security Rules (Cycle 1):**
    *   Complete full Firebase project setup beyond basic hosting.
    *   Define and implement robust Firebase security rules.
    *   (Partially covered by `TASK-P0-M0.1-T002`, `VALIDATED`, but needs Cycle 1 operationalization)
*   **Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting (Cycle 1):**
    *   Define and implement a comprehensive strategy for monitoring Roo's operations and ISA's performance.
    *   Set up appropriate logging and alerting mechanisms.
    *   (Corresponds to UDM Task `TASK-P0-M0.4-T022`, currently `TODO`)

## V. UDM Content & Prompt Finalization (Immediate TODOs from Phase 0)

This section highlights tasks directly from the UDM (`docs/udm/05-Roadmap-Lifecycle.md`) that are marked `TODO` but are crucial for completing Phase 0 properly and for guiding Cycle 1. Many of these involve finalizing prompts and UDM sections.

*   **Finalize Prompts for Roo's Core Logic & Self-Correction:**
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.2-T010`: Finalize Prompts for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview - Roo - Core Logic
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.2-T011`: Finalize Prompts for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview - Roo - Self-Correction
*   **Finalize Prompts for `ClaudeBrowserMode`:**
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.3-T017`: Finalize Prompts for Claude Sonnet 3.5 - ClaudeBrowserMode
*   **Complete UDM Sections:**
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.6-T031`: Populate UDM Section 01 - Introduction
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.6-T032`: Populate UDM Section 02 - Core Principles
    *   ... (and other UDM population tasks if still pending from T028-T030, T033-T035 though some are marked DONE or N/A)
*   **Finalize Core Application Structure Definition:**
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T019`: Define Core Application src Directory Structure (This is critical for starting Cycle 1 development)
*   **Resolve `TODO` UDM Task Definitions:**
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T020`: Define UDM Task - Automated Audit Trail Generation
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T021`: Define UDM Task - User Feedback Loop Integration
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T023`: Define UDM Task - Knowledge Graph Maintenance
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T024`: Define UDM Task - Security Patch Management
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T025`: Define UDM Task - Resource Optimization Strategy
    *   `TASK-P0-M0.4-T026`: Define UDM Task - Disaster Recovery Plan
*   **Review and Validate `VALIDATED` Tasks with Open Issues:**
    *   Re-evaluate `TASK-P0-M0.1-T001` (Audit Configuration Files) given the `apphosting.yaml` issue.
    *   Ensure all aspects of `TASK-P0-M0.1-T002` (Firebase Project Setup) and `TASK-P0-M0.1-T003` (Source Code Management Strategy) are truly complete and documented for autonomous operation.
    *   Confirm the validation of `MILESTONE-P0-M0.1` and `PHASE-0` (via `T009`) is appropriate given the number of outstanding `TODO`s.

Addressing these research needs, particularly the immediate TODOs from Phase 0, is crucial for laying a solid foundation for Cycle 1 and the subsequent development of the ISA.
